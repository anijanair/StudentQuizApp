# Student Quiz App

A basic app to take quiz from the provided csv file. It lets you choose the number of questions you want to be quizzed on, checks if you provided the correct answer, gives back the correct answer if the provided answer is incorrect, and at the end of the test gives the score and score percentage. Also it plots the progress of the past tests taken as a graph.


Features included in the project:
1. Has a masterloop
2. Reads data from an external csv file
3. Logs test progress into a text file
4. Uses 3 functions, and value returned from a function is being used.
5. Creates a list and uses value retrieved from it.
6. Vizualises the quiz progress as a graph.


To run the project:
1. Install Python 3.8
2. Pip install matplotlib

I have made more than five commits while uploading this project to GitHub.
